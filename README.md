# Flood-fill---Yuyang-Qi
This repository contains a Python script that implements the Flood Fill algorithm. This algorithm is used for color filling on 2D surfaces and is commonly used in image editing software (e.g. to change the color of an area using the "Fill" tool).

## Function
- Implements a flood-fill algorithm that recursively changes the color of all adjacent regions that have the same color as the starting point.
